# Open Terminal again.
 Enter the following command (replace /path/to/input.mov with the actual file path of your screen recording and /path/to/output.gif with the desired output file path):

"""
ffmpeg -i /path/to/input.mov -vf "fps=10,scale=320:-1:flags=lanczos" /path/to/output.gif

"""
Press Enter to run the command, and FFmpeg will convert your screen recording to a GIF.

Please note that you can adjust the "fps" value (frames per second) and "scale" value (width and height) in the command to your preference. The -1 in scale=320:-1 means that the height will be automatically calculated to maintain the aspect ratio.
